Based on https://github.com/coderholic/django-cities

## Using the API

Add param `format=json` in every request you want to perform to get JSON responses.
For example: `GET /v1/?format=json`.

API has self-documented format, so when you request to `/` (root of the API without any params) you'll get descriptions of all endpoints and can follow them for more descriptions.

You could also use filters when using this API:

### Filter: countries by continents

* `/v1/countries/?continents={id}` - get countries of the particular continent;
* `/v1/countries/?continents={id},{id},{id}` - get countries belongs to several continents.

Example: `GET /v1/countries/?continents=an`, `GET /v1/countries/?continents=an,af`

### Filter: currencies by countries

* `/v1/currencies/?countries={id}` - get currencies of the particular country;
* `/v1/currencies/?countries={id},{id},{id}` - get currencies belongs to several countries.

Example: `GET /v1/currencies/?countries=aq`, `GET /v1/currencies/?countries=aq,af`

### Filter: cities by countries

* `/v1/cities/?countries={id}` - get cities of the particular country;
* `/v1/cities/?countries={id},{id},{id}` - get cities belong to several countries.

Example: `GET /v1/cities/?countries=gr`, `GET /v1/cities/?countries=gr,us`

### Filter: cities by regions

* `/v1/cities/?regions={id}` - get cities of the particular region;
* `/v1/cities/?regions={id},{id},{id}` - get cities belong to several regions.

Example: `GET /v1/cities/?regions=tx`, `GET /v1/cities/?countries=tx,il`

### Filter: cities by continents

* `/v1/cities/?continents={id}` - get cities of the particular continent;
* `/v1/cities/?continents={id},{id},{id}` - get cities belong to several continents.

Example: `GET /v1/cities/?continents=eu`, `GET /v1/cities/?continents=eu,af`

### Filter: cities by slug

* `/v1/cities/?slugs={slug}` - get cities matching the particular slug, ;
* `/v1/cities/?slugs={slug},{slug},{slug}` - get cities matching to several slugs.

Example: `GET /v1/cities/?slugs=athens`, `GET /v1/cities/?slugs=athens,paris`
** where slug means the name of the city in lowercase with no accents and instead of spaces,  hyphens "-"

### Filter: multiple filters

You can also define multiple filters on the city endpoint.

Example: `GET /v1/cities/?slugs=athens,paris&countries=us&regions=tx`

### Filter: countries polygons by countries

* `/v1/countrypolygons/?countries={id},{id},{id}`

### Filter: get list of countries polygons for region(s)

* `/v1/countrypolygons/?regions={id},{id},{id}`

### Filter: all polygons by countries

* `/v1/polygons/?countries={id},{id},{id}`

### Filter: get list of all polygons for region(s)

* `/v1/polygons/?regions={id},{id},{id}`

## Running locally

Under virtual env (to create virtualenv, run `python3 -m venv env`):

    source env/bin/activate

    export LOCAL_DEV=1

    export DEBUG=1

Postgres + PostGIS setup (OS X):

    brew install postgis

    createuser cosmopolitan

    createdb cosmopolitan

    psql cosmopolitan

    alter user "cosmopolitan" with password '123456';

    grant all privileges on database cosmopolitan to cosmopolitan;

    CREATE EXTENSION postgis;

If you want your user to have super privileges:

    ALTER USER cosmopolitan WITH SUPERUSER;
