# Cosmopolitan
An API server for core data on places of the world.

http://cosmopolitan.openspending.org/

This API provides information about countries, cities and currencies all over the world and can be used as a cataloged data for various reasons.

Just a brief summary:

* contains a list of all countries in the world with country code, country continent and list of countries on the same continent;
* contains a list of all continents in the world with a list of countries for each continent;
* contains a list of all currencies in the world, each currency has a list of countries where this currency is being used.

Based on https://github.com/coderholic/django-cities

## Using the API

Add param `format=json` in every request you want to perform to get JSON responses.
For example: `GET /v1/?format=json`.

API has self-documented format, so when you request to `/` (root of the API without any params) you'll get descriptions of all endpoints and can follow them for more descriptions.

You could also use filters when using this API:

### Filter: countries by continents

* `/v1/countries/?continents={id}` - get countries of the particular continent;
* `/v1/countries/?continents={id},{id},{id}` - get countries belongs to several continents.

Example: `GET /v1/countries/?continents=an`, `GET /v1/countries/?continents=an,af`

### Filter: currencies by countries

* `/v1/currencies/?countries={id}` - get currencies of the particular country;
* `/v1/currencies/?countries={id},{id},{id}` - get currencies belongs to several countries.

Example: `GET /v1/currencies/?countries=aq`, `GET /v1/currencies/?countries=aq,af`

### Filter: countries polygons by countries

* `/v1/countrypolygons/?countries={id},{id},{id}`

### Filter: get list of countries polygons for region(s)

* `/v1/countrypolygons/?regions={id},{id},{id}`

### Filter: all polygons by countries

* `/v1/polygons/?countries={id},{id},{id}`

### Filter: get list of all polygons for region(s)

* `/v1/polygons/?regions={id},{id},{id}`

## Running locally

Under virtual env (to create virtualenv, run `python3 -m venv env`):

    source env/bin/activate

    export LOCAL_DEV=1

    export DEBUG=1

Postgres + PostGIS setup (OS X):

    brew install postgis

    createuser cosmopolitan

    createdb cosmopolitan

    psql cosmopolitan

    alter user "cosmopolitan" with password '123456';

    grant all privileges on database cosmopolitan to cosmopolitan;

    CREATE EXTENSION postgis;

If you want your user to have super privileges:

    ALTER USER cosmopolitan WITH SUPERUSER;
